# Neural_Network
Neural Network implementation from scratch and its comparision
##  train_net.py
This file contains the main imlpementation of neural network. The train.csv file contain some missing data so that have been replaced by mode of same feature. other information for this file will get in report.pdf
## test_standarad.py
This file contains the training with some other methods to compare the results of neural network with other standard learning algorithms
##predictions
these file contains the predictoins of the learning algorithms
## kaggle_test_data
contains test data
####Note: The correct file of actual result of test data is on kaggle
